# Deliverable 2

## 1. Positioning

#### Problem Statement

*Provide a statement to summarize the problem solved by your project according to the following structure (which is based on the OpenUP Vision Template):*

The problem of

*[describe the problem]*

affects

*[the stakeholders affected by the problem]*

the impact of which is

*[what is the impact of the problem? What does it cost?]*

*Example of a problem statement: “The problem of inefficient prioritization of homework assignments affects college students; the impact of which is delivering assignments past due and receiving low grades.” The problem should read as a problem (must be something bad that makes people spend time or money in an inefficient way.*

#### Production Position Statement

*A product position statement communicates the intent of the application and the importance of the project to all concerned personnel. The product should mitigate the aforementioned problem. Provide a statement according to the following structure:*

For *[target customer]*

Who *[statement of the need or opportunity]*

The *(product name) [product name]*

is a *[product category]*

That *[statement of key benefit; that is, the compelling reason to buy]*

Unlike *[primary competitive alternative]*

Our product *[statement of primary differentiation]*

*Example of a product position statement: “For college students who have many parallel homework assignments, MyPrioritizationApp is a planning app that crowdsources the identification of complexity and time necessary to accomplish assignments, supporting the informed prioritization; unlike myHomework Student Planner, our product does not rely on the judgment of a student who hasn’t started the homework yet.” Make sure your product position statement is related to your problem.*

#### Value Proposition and Customer Segment

*Report the value propositions and customer segments of your product. Make sure that your value proposition is coherent with the product position statement and contains the following elements:*

*i. what your product is*

*ii. the target customer*

*iii. the value your product provides*

*iv. why your product is unique*

*Example:*

*Value proposition: MyPrioritizationApp is a crowdsourced planning app {(i) what your product is} that allows college students {(ii) target costumer} to make better use of their time {(iii) the value your product provides}, prioritizing homework based on more accurate information of required time and complexity of the assignments {(iv) why your product is unique}.”*

*Consumer segment: College students who have many parallel homework assignments*

***Grading criteria (3 points, 1 for each section): The content of the subsections should contain all the required elements, follow the provided template, and be consistent with each other. The text should not contain typos or grammar issues.***

## 2. Stakeholders

*Make a list of all stakeholders of the project with a brief description of each one of them, emphasizing any responsibilities with the project. Examples of stakeholders include users, clients, competitors, detractors, developers, etc.*

***Grading criteria (1 point): The stakeholders can’t be too generic or specific. The list should reflect what was described in Section 1***

## 3. Functional Requirements (Features)

*Make a numbered list of requirements for your software. Just self-explanatory titles are enough at this point. Remember that requirements should deliver the value proposition and they must be consistent with the interviews you performed for the previous deliverable. You can talk again to your clients to help define the requirements. While writing the requirements, focus on the capabilities needed and not on how they should be implemented.*

- Website for desktop and mobile
- Functional calendar display for planning workouts
    - Edits and additions can be made
    - Tracks past workouts
    - System to track streaks
- Workout information pool
    - Recommendation algorithm for workouts
    - Questionnaire and calendar data collection to personalize workouts
    - Workout example videos
- Account system
    - Ability to create, personalize, and delete account
    - System to track progress of other users for friends and personal trainers

***Grading criteria (2 points): The list should be comprehensive (remember that you are not expected to implement all the requirements by the end of the course but you should list them). Follow the same pattern to describe all the requirements. The list of requirements should be coherent with the previous sections.***

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*Make a numbered list of non-functional requirements that are important for your software. Explain their importance. Follow the terminology of ISO/IEC 25010:2011. For each non-functional requirement, give an objective goal/measurement in order to provide verifiability for the requirement. You can find more details at the following URL:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8559686Links to an external site.*


***Grading criteria (2 points): Follow the ISO-IEC terminology, explain why they are important, provide verifiability criteria for each requirement.***

## 5. Minimum Viable Product

*What will be your MVP? Which features are you going to validate? How?*

***Grading criteria (2 points): Describe what would be considered the Minimal Viable Product and how it will be tested (e.g., via implementation, prototyping, Wizard of Woz, etc.). Make clear what you are going to validate. The MVP should be coherent with the previous sections.***

## 6. Use Cases

*Include a UML use case diagram for your project. There are many drawing tools that you can use.  I recommend the one we used in class, draw.io.*

***Grading criteria (5 points): Follow correctly the UML specification. The actors should be coherent with what was listed in sections 1 and 2. The use case diagram should be coherent with the list of requirements (section 3). The level of granularity of each use case should be adequate. The use cases should be adequately named.***

*Present one complete use case description (textual) for each member of the group. Therefore, if the group has 4 members, 4 use case descriptions are necessary. As the grading will not be individual, the group is responsible for keeping the quality and consistency of the whole document – avoid just splitting the work. Choose the most important use cases to describe. Follow the template provided in the slides.*

*After each use case description, add a sketch of the corresponding user interface. This will be a good opportunity to start thinking about usability.*

***Grading criteria (8 points): Follow the template to describe the use cases. Present an interface sketch for each use case. Describe the use case as a dialog between the user and the system. Do not use UI language in the description of the use case.***

## 7. User Stories

*Write two user stories for each member of the group. They can be related to the same features described in the use cases or to different ones. Adopt the following format: "As a ROLE, I want SOMETHING so that GOAL."*

*Establish a priority level for each user story and estimate how many hours each one will demand using the planning poker approach.*

***Grading criteria (6 points): Use the provided format. The user stories should be in an adequate level of granularity (not too broad nor too specific). Provide the priority and estimation for each user story.***

## 8. Issue Tracker

*The user stories should be registered in your GitHub issue tracker. Include here the link for your issue tracker and a screenshot of what you did.*

***Grading criteria (1 point): Provide the URL and screenshot of the issue tracker. The user stories should be registered there.***
