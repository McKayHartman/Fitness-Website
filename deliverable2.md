# Deliverable 2

## 1. Positioning

#### Problem Statement

*Provide a statement to summarize the problem solved by your project according to the following structure (which is based on the OpenUP Vision Template):*

The problem of **irregular or unproductive fitness sessions** affects **people who want to reach their fitness goals;** the impact of which is
**ineffective workout routines resulting in little to no progress.**


*Example of a problem statement: “The problem of inefficient prioritization of homework assignments affects college students; the impact of which is delivering assignments past due and receiving low grades.” The problem should read as a problem (must be something bad that makes people spend time or money in an inefficient way.*

#### Production Position Statement

*A product position statement communicates the intent of the application and the importance of the project to all concerned personnel. The product should mitigate the aforementioned problem. Provide a statement according to the following structure:*

For
Internet users
Who
Struggle with fitness planning,
The Fitness Planner is a website
That
Assists users in planning and developing fitness routines and setting and completing fitness goals for free
Unlike
MyFitnessPal,
Our product
Is a free website that centralizes and automates all fitness planning functions.

*Example of a product position statement: “For college students who have many parallel homework assignments, MyPrioritizationApp is a planning app that crowdsources the identification of complexity and time necessary to accomplish assignments, supporting the informed prioritization; unlike myHomework Student Planner, our product does not rely on the judgment of a student who hasn’t started the homework yet.” Make sure your product position statement is related to your problem.*

#### Value Proposition and Customer Segment

*Report the value propositions and customer segments of your product. Make sure that your value proposition is coherent with the product position statement and contains the following elements:*

1. What our product is: Our product is an easy-to-use fitness planning and tracking website.

2. Our target customer: Our target customer are internet users who struggle with creating workout routines and those that find it difficult to reach their fitness goals.

3. The value our product provides: We provide a product that is both minimal and efficient so that it provides the easiest user experience, making it less time-consuming to use a workout planner.

4. Why the product is unique: The product is unique because it will be less feature-heavy, more user-friendly, and will be without a subscription.

**Consumer segment: Internet users who have busy schedules.**

***Grading criteria (3 points, 1 for each section): The content of the subsections should contain all the required elements, follow the provided template, and be consistent with each other. The text should not contain typos or grammar issues.***

## 2. Stakeholders

- Users who struggle with planning their workouts:
  - Keeping mental notes of fitness goals does not improve routines
- Users who don’t want to pay for expensive apps:
  - Most alternatives and competitors have monthly or annual fees that deter users.
- Personal trainers:
  - Personal trainers can use it for each of their clients to keep track of statistics and fitness habits.


## 3. Functional Requirements (Features)

*Make a numbered list of requirements for your software. Just self-explanatory titles are enough at this point. Remember that requirements should deliver the value proposition and they must be consistent with the interviews you performed for the previous deliverable. You can talk again to your clients to help define the requirements. While writing the requirements, focus on the capabilities needed and not on how they should be implemented.*

- Website for desktop and mobile
- Functional calendar display for planning workouts
    - Edits and additions can be made
    - Tracks past workouts
    - System to track streaks
- Workout information pool
    - Recommendation algorithm for workouts
    - Questionnaire and calendar data collection to personalize workouts
    - Workout example videos
- Account system
    - Ability to create, personalize, and delete account
    - System to track progress of other users for friends and personal trainers

***Grading criteria (2 points): The list should be comprehensive (remember that you are not expected to implement all the requirements by the end of the course but you should list them). Follow the same pattern to describe all the requirements. The list of requirements should be coherent with the previous sections.***

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*Make a numbered list of non-functional requirements that are important for your software. Explain their importance. Follow the terminology of ISO/IEC 25010:2011. For each non-functional requirement, give an objective goal/measurement in order to provide verifiability for the requirement. You can find more details at the following URL:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8559686Links to an external site.*


***Grading criteria (2 points): Follow the ISO-IEC terminology, explain why they are important, provide verifiability criteria for each requirement.***

1. Portability
    - Goal: Website is usable on both desktop AND mobile devices.

2. Usability
    - Goal: Navigatable without external guidance.

3. Availability
    - Goal: Downtime of servers is kept to a minimum of 1 hour per week. 

4. Securability
    - Goal: Each users data can only be accessed by that user.


## 5. Minimum Viable Product

Personal user accounts/login
Calendar system for tracking consistency
Goal progress tracker
Workout recommendation system


## 6. Use Cases

*Include a UML use case diagram for your project. There are many drawing tools that you can use.  I recommend the one we used in class, draw.io.*

***Grading criteria (5 points): Follow correctly the UML specification. The actors should be coherent with what was listed in sections 1 and 2. The use case diagram should be coherent with the list of requirements (section 3). The level of granularity of each use case should be adequate. The use cases should be adequately named.***

*Present one complete use case description (textual) for each member of the group. Therefore, if the group has 4 members, 4 use case descriptions are necessary. As the grading will not be individual, the group is responsible for keeping the quality and consistency of the whole document – avoid just splitting the work. Choose the most important use cases to describe. Follow the template provided in the slides.*

*After each use case description, add a sketch of the corresponding user interface. This will be a good opportunity to start thinking about usability.*

***Grading criteria (8 points): Follow the template to describe the use cases. Present an interface sketch for each use case. Describe the use case as a dialog between the user and the system. Do not use UI language in the description of the use case.***

## 7. User Stories

*Write two user stories for each member of the group. They can be related to the same features described in the use cases or to different ones. Adopt the following format: "As a ROLE, I want SOMETHING so that GOAL."*

*Establish a priority level for each user story and estimate how many hours each one will demand using the planning poker approach.*

***Grading criteria (6 points): Use the provided format. The user stories should be in an adequate level of granularity (not too broad nor too specific). Provide the priority and estimation for each user story.***
