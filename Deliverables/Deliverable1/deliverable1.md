# Deliverable 1: Inception


### In one paragraph what is the project about?

We wanted to create a website for tracking fitness and helping with workout schedules. We all thought a website for fitness would be a good idea for a project, so we decided to focus on the niche of beginners. It is often challenging to figure out how to start, so we decided to design a system to help.

### Initial Value Proposition:

#### Customer Segment: Beginners/Those intimidated by the gym.

2.  **Interviewer:** Christian Lamb
   
    **Interviewee:** Spencer Dolesh

    **When:** 2/1/2025

**How often do you work out?**

I work out about 3-5 times a week.

**How long have you been working out?**

I’ve been working out for several years now.

**In what ways, and where do you exercise?**

I focus on strength training and cardio, mostly at the gym.

**Have you had trouble staying consistent with your fitness goals?**

Yes, I’ve struggled with staying consistent at times due to lack of time and motivation, but I try to stay on track by setting realistic goals and scheduling my workouts in advance.

**Have you ever attempted to follow fitness media or workout videos before?**

Yes, I’ve followed YouTube fitness channels for workout ideas and structure. It helps me stay on track and keep things interesting.

**Struggling with motivation?**

Occasionally, I struggle with motivation, especially when I’m not seeing immediate results. But I push through by setting small goals and working out with a friend.

**Would you be interested in a website with workout plans and a calendar to track your sessions?**

Yes, definitely. That would help me stay organized and committed to my fitness goals.

**What is the best way you stay motivated to reach your fitness goals?**

I stay motivated by setting clear goals for myself and rewarding myself when I hit milestones. It helps me keep moving forward.

**Customer Segment:** This individual fits well within the expected target audience, as they are already committed to fitness but struggle with consistency and motivation at times. They have experience with structured exercise and use external resources like YouTube fitness channels to maintain their routine.

**Insights:** A key takeaway from this interview is the importance of structured planning in maintaining workout consistency. The interviewee has years of experience with fitness but occasionally struggles with motivation and time management. They overcome this by setting realistic goals, scheduling workouts in advance, and using online fitness resources for guidance.

**Representative Statements:**
“I’ve been working out for several years now.”
“I struggle with staying consistent at times due to lack of time and motivation.”
“Following YouTube fitness channels helps me stay on track and keep things interesting.”
“A website with workout plans and a calendar would definitely help me stay organized and committed.”

**Assessment:** This individual has a strong foundation in fitness but benefits from structured guidance and accountability tools. Their interest in a workout tracking website suggests that such a resource could help people with similar struggles stay motivated and organized. While they have personal strategies for maintaining motivation, they see value in external tools that provide structure and goal tracking.

    **Interviewee:** Jayce Moody

    **When:** 2/2/2025

**How often do you work out?**

5 times per week.

**How long have you been working out?**

About a year

**In what ways, and where do you exercise?**

At the HLC. I exercise using machines or free weights

**Struggling with motivation?**

Yes.

**Would you be interested in a website with workout plans and a calendar to track your sessions?**

Less motivation, more discipline. Nobody wants to work out, having discipline will help you do it.

**Key insight:** Access to a gym is necessary for maintaining fitness goals.

**Quote:** “nobody wants to work out”

**Assessment:** This individual already has a consistent workout schedule and is staying with it. This may be a more difficult group to incorporate into our user base.

4.  **Interviewer:** Bryce Panza

    **When:** 2/1/2025

**Do you currently work out?**

No.

**Do you currently engage in any forms of fitness? How long have you been doing so?**

Very into fitness (running, climbing, mountain biking, and skiing), and has been doing so since youth. Does not go to gym or lift weights.

**How often do you engage in the above listed activities?**

Five or six days a week.

**How interested would you say you are in adding weight-lifting or another form of exercise as a hobby?**

Very. 8/10.

**What would you say the biggest issue has been for you in picking up weightlifting as a hobby?**

Consistency.

**Have you ever used any form of media with any of your fitness hobbies before or have you used it as inspiration for any workouts before?**

Yes.

**Would you be interested in a website with workout plans and a calendar to track your sessions?**

Yes.

**What would you say is the best way you have found to stay focused or motivated for your goals? What kind of an environment could we create for you to benefit your consistency?**

Some kind of a journal where you can write and save notes about your progress and be able to reflect on it.

**Customer Segment:** This individual is not someone that we necessarily anticipated in our original value proposition but that definitely fits into the scope of this project. This is a person who is already very active but is interested in branching out to another adjacent field, and has been struggling to do so for some time.

**Insights:** One of the most foundational insights in this interview is the desire for more consistency expressed by this individual. This is someone who is very active and involved with personal fitness but has had trouble extending his field to weightlifting, which he stated is something that he would like to do.

**Representative Statements:** This person stated that the biggest issue they faced in adding weightlifting as a hobby was consistency, which they said was something that was easier for them to build for their other hobbies but not for weightlifting.

**Assessment:** This individual did not have particularly strong opinions towards any direction. I believe the idea for potentially including a personal digital workout journal is a rather interesting concept and one worth noting but that is, perhaps, not particularly necessary, since this is a feature that may be harder to enhance with enough value to motivate customers to use this over a standard journal. Overall, I would say that this participant’s opinion was very neutral and could be encapsulated as “don’t care” in the way that they see the value but are not strongly drawn to it.

5.  **Interviewer:** Bryce Panza

    **When:** 2/1/2025

**Do you currently work out?**

No.

**Do you currently engage in any forms of fitness? How long have you been doing so?**

Swimming consistently for ten years.

**How often do you engage in the above listed activities?**

Twice a week.

**How interested would you say you are in adding weight-lifting or another form of exercise as a hobby?**

Not especially interested.

**What would you say the biggest issue has been for you in picking up weightlifting as a hobby? Have you had trouble with sticking to your goals before?**

For sure has had trouble at points with keeping up with goals.

**Have you ever used any form of media with any of your fitness hobbies before or have you used it as inspiration for any workouts before?**

No.

**Would you be interested in a website with workout plans and a calendar to track your sessions?**

Does not see applying to himself.

**What would you say is the best way you have found to stay focused or motivated for your goals? What kind of an environment could we create for you to benefit your consistency?**

Biggest difficulty is in getting started. Once you are there, it is easy to stay motivated, but getting yourself there is the hardest part.

**Customer Segment:** This is another individual who is already very active and has been active for a great deal of time but that does not see themself using this website. This individual represents a part of the population that is active but not particularly interested in adding new hobbies, which is a factor that we should consider in moving forward with this project, that not everyone who is active and does not already weightlift necessarily wants to do so.

**Key Insights:** Perhaps the biggest insight gathered from this individual was the strong indifference he had. To elaborate, our current proposition is not strong enough to attract someone who already has their routine developed and is happy with their workout progress. According to this potential insight, it may be best to focus our energy entirely on the population of newcomers rather than trying to spread ourselves too thin in attempting to attract the side of the population that would be searching for auxiliary information rather than essential information.

**Representative Statements:** When asked if he has had trouble sticking to his swimming schedule, he said that he “for sure [has] had trouble sticking to it”. He did not continue, however, to express remorse for doing so, which I believe is a big takeaway, because a great deal of people may not necessarily be trying to push themselves outside of a state that they have reached and that they enjoy being at. I feel that this further reflects the idea to tailor to newcomers, since this was a person that has a great deal of experience in his field and that knows where he wants to be already, but this could potentially be confirmation bias on my own side.

**Assessment:** The interest that this individual expressed was a very final “not interested”. I believe this offers us insight as to how to further narrow down our scope of audience, as this figure is already very fit and confident in himself with his schedule and does not see himself ever using a system like this. As such, this may reflect confidence as an important trait to recognize, as the subpopulation that will find use in this site mostly just not be confident in their abilities and knowledge. I feel that this is complemented by the results of Interview 4 as well, as that was a person who was very fit but could not find consistency on his own to an extent to encompass a habit.

6. **Interviewer:** Marco de la Rosa

    **Interviewee:** Ella Bermudez

    **When:** 2/1/2025

**Would you say you exercise?**

As only exercise? No. Am I physically active consistently? Yes.

**In what ways would you say you exercise if you do?**

We do warmups for frisbee, stretches and running, and then we play. It’s like three hours of exercise per week. I’m a cardio girl, I don’t really do weights.

**Why don’t you lift weights?**

I haven’t found a need to, I will probably around the summer, when I have to get training for carrying my instruments. 

**So in the case that you were working out, would you be interested in using a website with workout plans and like, suggestions for exercises?**

Probably, because I tried working out at the end of my freshman year, but I just did basic things like light weights. I didn’t really know where to focus to get the right results. It’s like, I’d start with cardio stretch, and then I would do, like, curls or lifts.

**Do you have any other comments?**

No. I should probably get to it. I know I can definitely do, like, push ups, sit ups, and things like that. It’s overall just like, right, get strong and not as weak. I think you should be able to at least control your own body weight. That’s always a good one.

**Customer Segment:** This individual was one envisioned in the value proposition, who is conscientious about exercise but not regular at it.
Key insights: This interview emphasized the importance of learning how to start. 

**Representative statements:** “I didn’t really know where to focus to get the right results.”

**Assessment:** This individual was interested in the product, and thought it was nice to have. While she was not concerned with usage at the moment, she felt that at some point it would become immensely useful. The interview reiterated that teaching how to start correctly is the best way to get someone to become confident in their progress.

7.  **Interviewer:** Marco de la Rosa

    **Interviewee:** Adrian Pelayo

    **When:** 2/2/2025

**Do you work out?**

Yeah. Not often, but sometimes I do.

**Okay, so how often do you say you work out?**

Well, it depends on what I consider working out. Like , usually, I do a couple stretches and then, I like, use a little bit of these weights I have, but that can be from like, one to two times a week.

**Okay. Would you say you’re working out the amount you want to, or it’s inconsistent?**

It’s absolutely inconsistent. I need to develop a good schedule.

**If there was, say, a website that tracked your fitness goals and gave you suggestions on how to exercise, would that help you be more consistent?**

Uh, definitely. Because half the time when I’m working out, I’m not even sure of like, what I’m doing or like, what’s good or what’s not, or like, you know, what’s right for me at the right moment.

**Alright, thank you. Do you have any more comments or suggestions?**

Nah, that’s pretty much it.

**Customer Segment:** This individual was one that fits well into the target audience, someone who doesn’t actively exercise but wants to.

**Key Insights:** The thing this interview made clear the most is that the consumer wants to know clearly if what they’re doing is good for progress.

**Representative Statements:** “I’m not even sure what I’m doing … or what’s good or what’s not.”

**Assessment:** The individual felt that the product was a must have, and after the interview, stated that he genuinely wanted to use the product once it was ready. The interviewee discussed the need to not only have a good schedule, but the need to reinforce confidence with proper workout information. As such, I feel like our product should really focus on teaching exactly what a person needs to do in order to build up their confidence.

8.  **Interviewer:** McKay Hartman

    **Interviewee:** Wiseon Hwang

    **When:** 2/2/2025

**How often do you work out?**

5 times per week.

**How long have you been working out?**

Four years

**In what ways, and where do you exercise?**

If I have time I go to the gym, and I usually go to wrestling practice.

**Have you had trouble staying consistent with your fitness goals?**

Yes. Time. Its hard to find time to be consistent. Working out becomes last on my priority list.

**Struggling with motivation?**

When I have time issues, my motivation also gets low, because i don't think about it as much.

**Would you be interested in a website with workout plans and a calendar to track your sessions?**

I feel like I would try it out and end up not using it.

**What is the best way you stay motivated to reach your fitness goals?**

Consistency.

**Features?**

All the good features you have to pay for in most apps and websites.

**Key insight:** Not everyone works out at the gym. Some play sports.

**Quote:** “Workout apps are difficult because they require daily input”

**Assessment:** This individual uses a sport (wrestling) to work out. This would be a very specific case which may be outside of our user base.
<br>
<br>

9.  **Interviewer:** McKay Hartman

    **Interviewee:** Jackson Maddock

    **When:** 2/2/2025

**How often do you work out?**

3 times a week.

**How long have you been working out?**

2 years ago.

**In what ways, and where do you exercise?**

If I am feeling stressed I go and work out. I usually go for a run.

**Have you had trouble staying consistent with your fitness goals?**

Yes. I don’t have a consistent schedule.

**Do you feel like you are where you want to be with your fitness goals?**

Absolutely not.

**Would you be interested in a website with workout plans and a calendar to track your sessions?**

Maybe. I’ve tried them before. They demotivated me with how much effort I needed to put in to set them up. They ask too many questions.

**What is the best way you stay motivated to reach your fitness goals?**

I don’t.

**Features?**

A daily check in/daily motivation.

**Key insight:** Asymmetric schedules make it difficult for some people to feel like they have time for physical fitness, even when they have brakes in their schedule.

**Quote:** “Fitness apps are annoying. I don’t like them because they are too question focused and they are always wanting me to use features I never want to use.”

**Assessment:** The person had difficulty with a consistent goal not because they could not keep track of their progress, but because they were waiting for their own motivation to get them to go on a run or go to the gym.
<br>
<br>

### Takeaways/General Assessment:

Many of the people interviewed seemed to stress the desire for an environment that would promote consistency for them, and this seemed to be the strongest recurring idea
Some individuals expressed interest in workouts but did not feel that they knew how to start, so confidence may be an aspect that we may want to consider while selecting a particular niche.
Some of the individuals interviewed already had experience with weightlifting or some form of fitness, and these individuals had much more mixed perspectives than those who were complete newcomers and simply wanted to add weightlifting as a hobby.
Inconsistency in a niche may be something to avoid or may mean we should narrow down our field of view even further.

### Final Value Proposition:

**Customer Segment:** Fitness Newcomers

**Proposition:** We help fitness newcomers build confidence and independence by offering an online learning platform that teaches newcomers the best way to begin and supports them into becoming consistent.
