# Installation

First, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

To install frontend or backend, go into the folder of **frontend** or **backend** and run `pnpm i`

## Backend
In backend, use `pnpm drizzle-kit push` to create the test database.

It's good to have the **"Sqlite Viewer"** extension installed in VS Code.
